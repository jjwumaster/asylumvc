          A Love Letter          </p>
          <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixteen years ago, I left Lehman Brothers in search of a calling. I spent a couple of years best described as meandering - writing, working odd jobs, grad school in Hong Kong - ultimately ending up back in NYC in 2009, having stumbled upon a young, passionate group of misfits that folks were calling “founders.” These founders felt more like artists than businesspeople, more obsessives than visionaries. They were mostly kids building the things that they wanted to see in the world (tumblr, vimeo, venmo, makerbot to name a few), and to my surprise, people called venture capitalists had given them money to pursue these dreams.
          </p>
          <p>
          I was in love with these weird fringe people, their underdog attitude and the fuck the man gumption - And above all else, the extraordinary craftsmanship and ambition required to build beautiful new works of art they called companies.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm inline-block bg-pink-300 bg-opacity-50 px-2 py-1">I dedicated my life to these people and this community, feeling deeply fortunate to have found my calling by participating in and supporting this unusual band of misfits - first at betaworks, and then Notation.</p>
          <p>
          A lot has happened to this ecosystem since the financial crisis more than 15 years ago. Startups and the venture capital business went from a cottage industry to a much larger institutional asset class. A pillar of our initial thesis for my previous firm Notation - that small seed firms would get too large - now feels quaint. Seed firms did indeed get much larger, but perhaps the even bigger change was that already large firms became truly massive - building platforms, suites of services, and staffs that rival the largest PE firms or hedge funds. We call them the “big banks.” Even some OG artisanal firms like YC went from a tiny group of scrappy misfit founders, to a credentialing factory churning 1000 startups per year.
          </p>
          <p>
          In many ways, this is what we all hoped for. To go from underdog to top dog, to build gigantic companies and make gigantic dollars, and surely I was a beneficiary of this growth. In 2021, during the height of ZIRP, I noticed I was as unhappy working in and funding startups as I had been working at Lehman in 2007 - The two industries had become almost indistinguishable from one another - No creativity or craft, purely focused on trying to squeeze out the extra dollar, before it all came crashing down. Good riddance I guess.

          It’s now 2024, and Silicon Valley pushes a narrative that everyone should start a startup. I disagree. In many cases, both in good outcomes and bad, the requirements to build something truly new and important are hellish. Early-stage founders don’t want to work with banks because banks don’t understand how weird and hard it is to build something great, they don’t recognize that behind every email and board meeting there’s a trail of broken relationships, poor health, sleepless nights and bad ramen for the fifth night in a row.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm inline-block bg-pink-300 bg-opacity-50 px-2 py-1">What if instead of treating founders like assets on a balance sheet, we treated them like obsessed artists going through the hardest journey of their lives?</p>
          <p>
          Today with my colleagues Jon and Mackenzie, I’m launching Asylum Ventures to answer that question. Asylum aims to be a source of calm, trust and support for founders who are manifesting beauty through one of the hardest things you can do: starting a company. VCs are never the difference between success and failure, but we can make it suck just a little less, both for the founder and their life, as well as their company and their work.

            Asylum 2024 is a $55M fund, our first under this brand. We make $1-2M investments a few times per year and partner with founders raising their first capital in order to build something fundamentally new and beautiful. We lead with love and focus on people - we don’t give a shit if you have fancy degrees or credentials - we care about whether you’re obsessed with the problem and customer, whether you’re willing to do absurdly difficult things to perfect your craft and win, over a very long period of time. We’re a small team, we love art and great ideas, disgustingly ambitious and hard working and driven, we don’t offer big box platform services, it’s just us doing the actual work.
            </p>
            <p>
            Building companies is hard; Asylum aims to be the least-shitty part of that process, and we will never get in your way or ask you to do something that distracts from your mission. We expect you to be your authentically weird self, to build your company your way. Our primary service in addition to capital is trust - We’ve earned this trust with founders over the past 15 years, and we believe it has to be earned everyday going forward. We want to understand your motivations, but we don’t judge them. We care about money and returns to the extent that it allows us to continue to do what we do, but more than anything we just want to be close to greatness, both in the work we do and the founders we hope to work with. If we earn it, we’d like to partner with you for the rest of our lives, in many cases over multiple companies.

            <p>Jon calls Asylum Ventures my final act of a multi-decade revenge arc against bankers. I think he’s partly right. Even more so, Asylum Ventures is a love letter to founders…</p>

            <p className="text-sm inline-block bg-pink-300 bg-opacity-50 px-2 py-1">More beauty and craft, less factory line</p>
            <p className="text-sm inline-block bg-pink-300 bg-opacity-50 px-2 py-1">More weird and rebellious, less safe and derivative</p>
            <p className="text-sm inline-block bg-pink-300 bg-opacity-50 px-2 py-1">More really hard inspired work, less status games</p>
            <p className="text-sm inline-block bg-pink-300 bg-opacity-50 px-2 py-1">More risk and carry, less management fees and mediocre performance</p>
            <p className="text-sm inline-block bg-pink-300 bg-opacity-50 px-2 py-1">More authentic expression of self, less patagonia vest</p>

            <p>To be clear, attention to craft and beauty does not mean small. The largest companies in the world are iconic because of their attention to craft and beauty. Today, the founder artist has access to tools and audience on a scale previously unimaginable and banks become more obsolete with each passing decade - the future belongs to the Weird - we’re here to help you claim it.</p>
